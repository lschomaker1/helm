# **Helm ARCANE**
### *Automated Resource, Customer, Accounting, and Network Environment*

---

## **Overview**

**Helm ARCANE** is a next-generation management and CRM platform designed to replace outdated, inefficient legacy systems with a unified, fully customizable, and mobile-ready application suite.  

Developed internally using **Ruby on Rails**, ARCANE empowers Helm Group to consolidate operations, streamline technician workflows, and modernize data handling—all while reducing cost and dependency on external vendors.

## **Current Challenges**

### 1. Legacy Framework Dependence
- Current platform built on **Apache Cocoon** and **HCL Notes (formerly IBM Notes)**—both aging, closed-source, and subscription-bound technologies.  
- **Apache Cocoon** has reached end-of-life (no security updates post-2023).  
- Reliance on external licensing increases long-term operational cost and cybersecurity risk.

### 2. Poor Performance and Usability
- Outdated, slow, and desktop-centric interface.  
- Limited mobile compatibility and minimal support for field technician access.

### 3. Fragmented Systems
- Multiple disjointed tools are needed to manage customers, work orders, and billing.  
- Integration requires extra licensing and manual overhead.

### 4. Limited Customization
- “One-size-fits-all” vendor solutions restrict functionality and innovation.  
- Companies must adapt their workflow to the software—not the other way around.

---

## **ARCANE: The Solution**

### 1. Built on Modern, Secure, Open-Source Technology
- Developed entirely with **Ruby on Rails**, backed by an active open-source community.  
- Regular security updates, modular codebase, and transparent development process.  
- Eliminates dependence on external licensing—**no per-seat or per-module costs**.

### 2. Mobile-First, Reactive Design
- Fully responsive interface for smartphones, tablets, and desktops.  
- Can be seamlessly wrapped into native iOS/Android apps using **Turbo Native**.  
- Technicians can log time, update work orders, and access customer data directly in the field.

### 3. Unified Platform for All Business Functions
- Combines CRM, work orders, purchase orders, PM scheduling, time entries, quotes, and accounting integration—all under **one login**.  
- Streamlines workflow and ensures real-time synchronization across departments.  
- Direct feedback loop allows Helm staff to request and receive tailored feature updates.

### 4. Limitless Customization and Expansion
- Scalable architecture supports new modules such as:  
  - Automatic **OJT** logging based on time entries  
  - Remote monitoring and control of Helm-managed systems  
  - **Graphical site maps** and job-site dashboards  
  - Technician scheduling optimization and GPS-based dispatch  
- Future-ready for AI-driven diagnostics, predictive maintenance, and smart-reporting integrations.
