#Helm ARCANE - Automated Resource, Customer, Accounting, and Network Enterprise#

Designed to address the following problems of the CRM/management suite currently employed:
  1. Made in Apache Cocoon and HCL Notes (formerly IBM Notes). HCL Notes not defunct but requires a subscription to access and use its basic create, read, update, and destroy functionality, fully closed source. Apache Cocoon has been marked end of life with no security updates since 2023, with no further coming in the future.
  2. Poor, slow, outdated design with average-at-best mobile performance
  3. Is not monolithic; still need to pay further licensing fees and forced into more office-side overhead to make any supplementary resource management programs work in tandem.
  4. Is neither richly customized nor customizable, with Perfectware stating some limited customizing capabilities, but largely selling the same product to their customers.

How does it address these issues?

  1. Made fully using Ruby on Rails, an elegant, iOS and Android native framework in the language Ruby, known to be one of the most conversational, easy-to-maintain, and unproblematic frameworks in use today; and in using this community-rich open source framework, security updates are still released regularly, significantly reducing risk of cyberattack/exploit by an attacker.
  2. Uses a fully-reactive, mobile-friendly design (both on tablets and phones); ready to be wrapped using Turbo Native to create an iOS or Android application for techs to download and use natively
  3. Combines all company-required functions and processes into one robust suite, using one login, one webpage, from any device. Also allows for company feedback to directly change the functionality of the application.
  4. Provides full customizability with a virtual "sky is the limit" development envelope in which to expand. Already added automatic OJT entry based on time entries, can add direct online remote access to Helm-managed controls systems, graphical site maps, and any other value-added tasks/processes suitable for an online application suite.
